## ❔ What it is

SafeNova is a single-page web app that lets you create encrypted **containers** — isolated vaults where you can organize files in a folder structure, much like a regular desktop file manager. Everything is encrypted client-side before being written to storage. Nothing ever leaves your device.

![](./pics/screenshot.png)

Key properties:

-   **Zero-knowledge** — the app never sees your password or plaintext data
-   **Offline-first** — works entirely without network access
-   **No installation** — start the local server and you're running (or use online)

---

## ⚙️ Features

-   **Multiple containers** — each with its own password and independent storage limit (8 GB per container)
-   **Virtual filesystem** — nested folders, drag-to-reorder icons, customizable folder colors
-   **File operations** — upload (drag & drop or browse; folder upload with 4× parallel encryption), download, copy, cut, paste, rename, delete
-   **Built-in viewers** — text editor, image viewer, audio/video player, PDF viewer
-   **Hardware key support** — optionally use a WebAuthn passkey to strengthen the container salt
-   **Session memory** — optionally remember your session per tab (ephemeral, recommended) or persistently until manually signed out, using AES-GCM-encrypted session tokens; persistent sessions survive browser restarts
-   **Cross-tab session protection** — a container can only be actively open in one browser tab at a time; a lightweight lock protocol detects conflicts and offers instant session takeover
-   **Container import / export** — portable `.safenova` container files
-   **Export password guard** — configurable setting (on by default) to require password confirmation before exporting; when disabled, active-session key is used directly
-   **Sort & arrange** — sort icons by name, date, size, or type; drag to custom positions
-   **Container integrity scanner** — 27 automated checks (21 VFS structural + 6 database-level) with one-click auto-repair, **Deep Clean** (flattens over-nested folder trees, repairs all metadata), and a backup prompt before any destructive operation
-   **Settings** — three tabs: personalization, statistics, activity logs
-   **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Delete`, `F2`, `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C/X/V`, `Ctrl+S` (save in editor), `Escape`
-   **Mobile-friendly** — touch drag, rubber-band selection, single/double-tap gestures

## 🔐 Encryption

| Layer           | Algorithm                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Key derivation  | Argon2id (19 MB memory, 2 iterations, 1 thread)        |
| File encryption | AES-256-GCM (random 96-bit IV per file)                |
| VFS encryption  | AES-256-GCM (same key, independent IV)                 |
| Session tokens  | AES-256-GCM, dual-key: per-tab ephemeral or persistent || Browser key wrap   | HKDF-SHA-256 from browser fingerprint, never stored   || Integrity check | AES-256-GCM verification blob authenticated on open    |

Every file is encrypted individually — each with its own freshly generated IV. The virtual filesystem (folder tree, file names, sizes, positions) is encrypted as a separate blob using the same derived key. The plaintext password is never stored; only the derived key is held in JavaScript memory for the duration of an active session.

File keys are derived from passwords through **Argon2id** with OWASP-recommended minimum parameters (19 MB memory cost, 2 iterations), providing strong resistance against brute-force and GPU-accelerated attacks.

### Session token security

SafeNova uses a **dual-key model** for session storage — an ephemeral per-tab key and a persistent shared key — each scoped to a distinct user intent.

#### Current tab session _(Recommended)_

The 32-byte Argon2id key material is encrypted with **`snv-sk`** — a per-tab AES-256-GCM key stored in `sessionStorage`. This means:

-   The session blob (`snv-s-{cid}`) lives in `sessionStorage` and is readable only by the exact tab that created it
-   Closing the tab permanently destroys `snv-sk` — no residue remains in any persistent storage
-   An attacker with access to `localStorage` or disk snapshots gains nothing, because the decryption key exists only in volatile `sessionStorage`

This is the recommended option: the session is automatically gone as soon as the tab is closed.

#### Stay signed in

The key material is encrypted with **`snv-bsk`** — a shared AES-256-GCM key available to all tabs of the same browser origin.

**Browser-fingerprint key wrapping.** Before `snv-bsk` is written to `localStorage`, it is itself encrypted with a separate *wrap key* that is derived on-the-fly via **HKDF-SHA-256** from a browser fingerprint and **never stored anywhere**:

```
fingerprint = origin \0 language \0 hardwareConcurrency \0 colorDepth \0 pixelDepth
wrap_key    = HKDF-SHA-256( ikm=fingerprint, salt=0×32, info="snv-browser-wrap-v1" )
snv-bsk (localStorage) = IV(12) || AES-256-GCM( wrap_key, raw_bsk_bytes )
```

Consequences:

-   Any tab in the **same browser** recomputes the identical fingerprint → identical wrap key → can decrypt `snv-bsk` and resume the session seamlessly
-   An attacker who **copies `localStorage`** to another machine or a different browser (disk image, malware exfil) will encounter a different deployment origin and/or hardware profile → different fingerprint → different wrap key → `snv-bsk` decryption fails → all session blobs become permanently opaque to them
-   The fingerprint is intentionally **stable**: `navigator.userAgent` and `navigator.platform` are excluded because Chrome auto-updates silently (changing the UA string between launches), which would otherwise invalidate sessions on every browser update. Only properties that rarely or never change are used: deployment origin, system language, CPU core count, and display color depth
-   If the fingerprint does change (e.g., a system language switch or hardware reconfiguration), the stored `snv-bsk` can no longer be decrypted; a new key is generated automatically and the user must re-enter the password once — any `snv-sb-{cid}` blobs encrypted with the old key are silently dropped
-   **Legacy format migration:** `snv-bsk` entries written before fingerprint-wrapping was introduced (raw 32-byte keys, no IV prefix) are detected by their exact byte length and silently re-wrapped in the current `IV(12) || AES-GCM` format on first access — no user action required
-   The session expires after **7 days** (TTL baked into the encrypted payload), or immediately on explicit sign-out

**Session payload format.** Both scope types use the same blob layout: `IV(12) || AES-256-GCM(scope_key, expiry(8 bytes, uint64 LE) || raw_key(32 bytes))`. The AES-GCM call is authenticated with the container ID as additional data (`snv-session:{cid}`), preventing a blob from one container from being replayed to unlock a different container. Tab-scope sessions use `expiry = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (no TTL — the tab's `sessionStorage` is the only lifetime bound); browser-scope sessions carry a hard 7-day expiry.

**Remaining trade-off:** an attacker with live access to the running browser process (e.g. malicious extension, XSS) can still call the same fingerprint function and derive the wrap key. The browser-fingerprint layer protects against *offline* credential theft (disk images, direct `localStorage` dumps), not against in-browser code execution.

## 📋 Requirements

-   A modern browser: **Chrome 90+**, **Firefox 90+**, **Safari 15+**, or **Edge 90+**
-   Web Crypto API must be available — this requires either **HTTPS** or **`localhost`**
-   No plugins, no extensions, no backend

---

## 🚀 Getting started

### Option A — Use online version

SafeNova is hosted on: [https://safenova.dosx.su/](https://safenova.dosx.su/)

### Option B — Local server

A zero-dependency PowerShell server is included:

```powershell
.\\.server.ps1
```

Or right-click the file → **Run with PowerShell**. It starts an HTTP server on port `7777` (or the next free port) and opens the app in your default browser.

No external installs needed — it uses the Windows built-in `HttpListener`.

## 🔒 How containers work

1. **Create** a container with a name and password
2. **Unlock** the container — Argon2id derives the key from your password
3. Files you upload are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being saved to IndexedDB
4. The virtual filesystem (folder tree + icon positions) is also encrypted and saved separately
5. **Lock** the container — the derived key is immediately wiped from memory

All container data is scoped to the current browser and device. Use **Export Container** to back up or transfer to another device.

---

## 📄 The `.safenova` Container Format

Exported containers are saved as `.safenova` files. This is a **self-contained structured archive** with a versioned, deterministic layout. It is designed so that no file content or filesystem metadata is ever present in plaintext within the archive.

### Archive sections

| Section                      | Role                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `container.xml`              | Plaintext container manifest: name, creation timestamp, Argon2id salt, and the AES-GCM verification IV and blob needed to authenticate a password at import. No file names or content appear here |
| `meta/0`                     | The IV (initialization vector) used to encrypt the VFS blob                                                                                                                                       |
| `meta/1`                     | The encrypted VFS blob — the complete folder hierarchy, file names, MIME types, sizes, timestamps, icon positions, and folder colors, all ciphertext                                              |
| `meta/2`                     | The IV for the encrypted file manifest                                                                                                                                                            |
| `meta/3`                     | The encrypted file manifest — a JSON structure mapping each file’s internal ID to its byte offset and length within `workspace.bin`, encrypted with the container key                             |
| `safenova_efs/workspace.bin` | A single contiguous block of raw ciphertext — the encrypted content of every file, concatenated end-to-end. Without the decryption key, file boundaries and content are indistinguishable         |
| `meta/activity_logs/0`       | _(Optional)_ The encrypted activity log, included only when the `exportWithLogs` container setting is enabled                                                                                     |

### Design properties

**Zero plaintext leakage.** The only identifiable plaintext in the archive is the container name in `container.xml` and the Argon2id salt. All file names, folder structure, and content are ciphertext.

**Lazy import.** A `.safenova` file can be imported without entering the container password. The encrypted workspace is stored as-is internally, flagged as a `lazyWorkspace`. It is expanded into the local database only on first unlock — so import is instantaneous regardless of container size.

**Self-authenticating.** The salt and verification blob in `container.xml` allow the application to confirm the correctness of a supplied password before touching any file data, preventing unnecessary decryption work.

**Versioned.** The `version` attribute in the XML manifest distinguishes between format generations, enabling forward-compatible import logic. Currently only version 3 is supported; earlier formats have been retired.

## ⚡ Performance

SafeNova schedules AES-GCM operations to run with maximum concurrency, taking full advantage of hardware AES acceleration exposed by the browser’s Web Crypto API.

### Adaptive concurrency

The degree of parallelism is computed once at startup:

```js
const _CRYPTO_CONCURRENCY = Math.min(8, navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 4);
```

This serves as the default batch width for all bulk encrypt/decrypt loops. On an 8-core machine, up to 8 files are processed simultaneously.

### Bulk upload

For each batch of files the application reads all `ArrayBuffer` payloads in parallel, encrypts the batch in parallel, then writes every encrypted record to IndexedDB in a **single transaction**, eliminating the per-file transaction overhead that would otherwise dominate for large numbers of small files.

### ZIP export

Exporting files as an archive uses `DB.getFilesByIds()` — a single IndexedDB read transaction that fetches all required records concurrently via parallel `IDBObjectStore.get()` calls. Decryption of all records is then dispatched in one `Promise.allSettled` call rather than being serialised through fixed-size batches.

### Password change

Re-encrypting a container under a new key dispatches all `decrypt → encrypt` pairs for every file **fully in parallel**. Results are accumulated and written back in a single `saveFiles()` batch, reducing total elapsed time from `O(n × sequential awaits)` to approximately one parallel round-trip plus one database write.

### Container export

Assembly of `workspace.bin` is performed with a **single pre-allocated `Uint8Array`** and sequential `TypedArray.set()` calls, avoiding repeated allocations and intermediate staging arrays.

---

## 🛡️ Cross-Tab Session Protection

To prevent a container from being open in two browser tabs simultaneously — which would risk conflicting VFS writes — SafeNova maintains a lightweight **session lock** in `localStorage`.

When a container is unlocked, the tab writes a claim entry (`snv-open-{id}`) containing its unique tab identifier and a timestamp. A **heartbeat** refreshes the timestamp every 5 seconds. Any other tab that reads a live claim (timestamp within the 30-second TTL) before opening the same container is shown a conflict dialog offering to take over the session.

On accepting the takeover, the requesting tab writes a **kick flag** into the claim entry. The original tab listens for `storage` events on this key and immediately locks itself when the flag is detected. On normal tab close, `beforeunload` and `pagehide` remove the claim entry so the container becomes available to other tabs without waiting for the TTL to expire.

---

## 🛡️ Container Integrity Scanner

The built-in scanner performs a deep analysis of the virtual disk image, encrypted file table, folder hierarchy, desktop layout, and workspace environment. It runs **27 checks** in two phases:

### Phase 1 — VFS structural checks (21 steps, synchronous)

| #   | Check                        | Repairs                                                                        |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 12  | File metadata validation     | Strips unknown properties                                                      |
| 13  | Duplicate name detection     | Auto-renames collisions                                                        |

| 16  | Folder position maps         | Creates missing position maps                                                  |

| 18  | Position collision detection | Relocates overlapping icons                                                    |
| 19  | Grid alignment verification  | Snaps off-grid positions                                                       |
| 20  | Folder depth analysis        | O(n) memoized; warns when nesting > 50 levels                                  |
| 21  | Node count summary           | Informational — file/folder/position counts                                    |

### Phase 2 — Database-level checks (6 steps, async)

| #   | Check                      | Repairs                                                                                                             |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | File data existence        | Removes VFS nodes whose encrypted blob is missing from IndexedDB                                                    |
| 2   | Encryption IV integrity    | Accepts Array/Uint8Array/ArrayBuffer (canonical: plain Array); coerces base64 strings; purges only if truly invalid |
| 3   | File blob integrity        | Resets declared size to 0 if blob is empty                                                                          |
| 4   | Orphaned storage records   | Deletes DB records not referenced by any VFS node                                                                   |
| 5   | Record container binding   | Fixes records bound to wrong container ID                                                                           |
| 6   | Container size consistency | Recalculates totalSize from live VFS nodes                                                                          |

Before auto-repair runs, a **confirmation dialog** recommends exporting the container as a `.safenova` backup — you can do this without leaving the scanner. After a successful repair, a verification scan runs automatically to confirm all issues are resolved.

If auto-repair cannot fix the remaining issues, a **Deep Clean** option becomes available. It performs an aggressive structural rebuild in five O(n) passes:

1. Scan DB storage records
2. Purge dead nodes — remove every VFS node with no real encrypted data behind it
3. Flatten deep folder chains — files nested more than 50 levels deep are reparented to their closest ≤50-level ancestor; all file data is preserved
4. Repair metadata — each node with a missing or invalid `ctime`/`mtime` gets today's date
5. Clean storage records — remove orphaned DB entries in a single batch transaction

After Deep Clean, a verification scan runs automatically. A backup is offered before Deep Clean runs, same as for auto-repair.
